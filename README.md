Kingdoms 2
=============

Kingdoms 2 is a chunk based town-nation hierarchy very loosely based on Towny. This plugin was originally developed for the ImDeity Kingdoms Minecraft Server however now were going to release it to the community! This plugin has been running on our server since December of 2011. One of the major reasons we were pushed to create this system is at that time Towny was very very unstable and unreliable and we had to do a lot to patch it up, as well as it was lacking MySQL support. We then created this plugin to fill those holes as well as put our own spin on the plugin.
